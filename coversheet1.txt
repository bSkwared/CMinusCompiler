CS 3510 - Compiler
Project 1
Timothy Smith and Blake Lasky


Requirements:
    Build a home page with your name, course name, and links to the projects
    and people's choice. Build an APE frame. Fill the frame with static data 
    where dynamic data will be placed later.


Design:
    For my personal page, I just made some areas that had widths based on
    percentages. It was really all about marketing myself to future employers.
    On BEAR, I chose to go with a material floating cards look.


Implementation:
    On my personal page, CSS was used to make things grow and shrink. However,
    for BEAR, Foundation is being used to achieve responsiveness.

Summary and Conclusion:
    In this project we got to refresh our HTML and CSS skills. In addition to
    being a refresher, I got more experience with design, as I had to design my
    two pages. I also learned about Foundation and how it can be used to
    develop responsive websites easily.
